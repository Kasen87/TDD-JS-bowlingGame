# Learning Test-Driven Development with Jasmine & Node
---
This project is my first introduction into TDD processes thanks to Eleni. 

The vague goal is to build a simple bowling game that will ask for up to four players and then process their turns for them to determine a *random* victor.

## Current Progress
- *bowlingGame.js* _(in-progress)_
  - Test for Successful Init
  - Test for Successful Bowl Action
- *player.js* _(in-progress)_
  - Test for successful Init
  - Test for successful score change
- *More Objects?*
